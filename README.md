## Equiformer - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11990">Equiformer</a>, SE3/E3 equivariant attention network that reaches new SOTA, and adopted for use by <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.07.511322v1">EquiFold (Prescient Design)</a> for protein folding

The design of this seems to build off of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10503">SE3 Transformers</a>, with the dot product attention replaced with MLP Attention and non-linear message passing from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14491">GATv2</a>. It also does a depthwise tensor product for a bit more efficiency. If you think I am mistakened, please feel free to email me.

Will report how it does on my toy task compared to some other networks I am more familiar with, once construction is complete.

This repository may eventually contain an implementation of EquiFold as well, with the added FAPE loss + structural violation checks

## Install

```bash
$ pip install equiformer-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from equiformer_pytorch import Equiformer

model = Equiformer(
    num_tokens = 24,
    dim = (4, 4, 2),
    dim_head = (4, 4, 4),
    heads = (2, 2, 2),
    num_degrees = 3,
    depth = 4,
    attend_self = True,
    input_degrees = 1,
    reduce_dim_out = True
).cuda()

feats = torch.randint(0, 24, (1, 128)).cuda()
coors = torch.randn(1, 128, 3).cuda()
mask  = torch.ones(1, 128).bool().cuda()

out = model(feats, coors, mask) # (1, 128)

out.type0 # invariant type 0    - (1, 128)
out.type1 # equivariant type 1  - (1, 128, 3)
```

## Testing

Tests for spherical harmonics, network equivariance etc

```bash
$ python setup.py test
```
